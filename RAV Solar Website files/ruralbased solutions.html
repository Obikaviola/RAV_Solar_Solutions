                    <h4 class="text-center">A breakthrough in reliable energy for rural telephony</h4>
                    <p class="text-center">A highly functioning rural communication system will open up a lot of developmental opportunities for rural Africa. However, the lack of access to stable electricity from the national grid has made it extremely difficult for network providers to establish telecom base stations in rural areas. With the RAV solar RuralBase solutions, telecom companies now have the means to expand their coverage areas to rural communities with integrated solar units that possess the efficiency, reliability, and durability to constantly power outdoor base stations in rural areas with no connection to the national grid.</p>

                    <h4 class="text-center">Bridging the communication gap across the African market</h4>
                    <p class="text-center">Africa's emerging markets will benefit immensely from a more fluid value chain, especially in our manufacturing sectors. The availability of widespread and reliable telecommunications services across urban and rural Africa is the key to bridging the communication gap between the supply chain and the market. This is why the RAV solar RuralBase solutions have been designed to be the perfect energy source to drive the rapid expansion of telecom base stations in both rural and urban areas. These solar units are resistant to weather, require minimal maintenance, and can be monitored remotely.</p>

                    <h4 class="text-center">Eliminate Maintenance and Logistics Hurdles</h4>
                    <p class="text-center">Network providers often have to rely on diesel generators to power important rural base stations due to a lack of access to stable electricity from the national grid. It turned out that fueling and maintaining these generators in rural communities have become logistical nightmares and unsafe endeavors for many base station operators. The RAV solar RuralBase solution is a durable power supply unit that requires very little running cost and comes with a SolarBase App that allows you to monitor your solar unit remotely.</p>
